#Gallery use HTML CSS & jQuery

##Description

##Setup
Copy CSS and JS directories to your website. You can change the images and add other modules depands on your need. Customization  is easy! Have a fun!

  1.Page1 used jquery to create dom. So it's close coupled, difficult to test & modify. It's bad code style.

  2.Page2 is much easyier to understand.You can change the image urls with yours and choose the filter which you like just by pass object{ filter : value } to the function. And you could add your filter too. It may fail when you test on your personal computer because of the canvas element. You can test with firefox.
